# genome-viewer
Explore programmatic (R or python) alternatives to IGV for genome visualization of epigenomic signal tracks

## Gviz
An R package called Gviz is popular for genome visualization.

See my notebooks here:
[gviz tutorial](https://github.com/wuronald/genome-viewer/blob/main/gvis_tutorial.Rmd)
+ This is the standard tutorial from the Gviz official vignette.
[gviz atac](https://github.com/wuronald/genome-viewer/blob/main/gvis_atac.Rmd)
+ Here I attempt to visualize two bulk ATAC-seq samples by using their bigwig files.

## Figeno
A python package called Figeno. Has a GUI but can also be used on a CLI. All configuration and settings is dependent on a json file. 

See notebooks here:
